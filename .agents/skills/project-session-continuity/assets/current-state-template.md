# Current Delivery State

## Purpose
This file records the active slice, exact next permitted action, risks, and session-boundary decision. It is not a product, architecture, API, schema, data, or security authority. Correct this file when it conflicts with controlling sources.

## Active Slice Manifest
- The current permission boundary is `docs/delivery/active-slice-manifest.json`.
- A current-state update, handoff, review marker, or new chat cannot authorize work outside that manifest.

## Current Verified Repository State
- Record the verified branch, local head, remote baseline, and working-tree state.

## Active Work
- Record the bounded slice currently in progress.

## Next Permitted Action
- Resolve material project decisions before drafting controlled documents or coding.

## Work Explicitly Not Started
- Implementation is not started.

## Candidate Decisions Still Not Final
- Record candidates that must not be treated as approved decisions.

## Risks And Blockers
- Record material risks, blocked checks, and unresolved conflicts.

## New Session Decision
- Continue only while work remains the same bounded slice.

## New Session Start Instructions
```text
Paste the latest handoff's next-session prompt into a new Codex chat. First run the project session-start gate. Then read current state, its latest handoff, the workflow manifest, and controlling sources. Continue only from the exact next permitted action and stop if the workflow manifest blocks it.
```

## Update Contract
Update this file when the active slice, next action, risks, blockers, review state, permission manifest, latest handoff, or session-boundary decision changes. Do not copy chat history into this file.
